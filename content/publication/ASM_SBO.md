abstract = "Surrogate-based optimization is criticized in high-dimensional cases because it cannot scale well with the input dimension. In order to overcome this issue, we adopt a snapshot active subspace method to reduce the input dimension. A smoothing operation of samples is used to reduce the demand for snapshots in the construction of active subspaces. This operation significantly reduces the computational cost on the one hand, and on the other hand, it leads to more feasible subspaces. We use a 90% âˆ¼ 95% energy coverage criterion to define the dimension of the subspace. With this criterion, the surrogate-based airfoil optimization in the active subspace is both efficient and effective. We also validate this optimization approach in an ONERA M6 wing optimization case with 220 shape variables. Compared with original surrogate-based optimization, the new approach reduces the computational time by 70% and obtains a more practical design with a smaller drag."
abstract_short = "This paper presents a method coupling surrogate-based optimization with the active subspace method (ASM-SBO), which protects high-dimensional aerodynamic shape optimization from the [curse of dimensionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality)."
